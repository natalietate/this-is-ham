### Here's a cool little 'jukebox' to listen to a sample of songs from *Hamilton*!

In case you're not familiar with the Broadway production of Hamilton, you may listen to first 3 songs from the soundtrack as an introduction to the show.

Press play or select a song to start listening! You may play, pause or stop the music at any time. 

*(You'll have to supply your own audio files, sorry about that.)*
